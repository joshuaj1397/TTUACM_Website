  If port 80 doesn't work for you, you may change the port in /bin/www (line 15)

      var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '80');

  A development port environment variable (DEV_PORT) should be declared to run the test suite and the server.

  Port 8080 is the port that is currently set as an OAuth2 api callback endpoint.
  If development port does not match, authentication will fail
